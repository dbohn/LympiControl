# LympiControl

This is a simple tool to import images from your Olympus OM-D EM-1 or EM-10 (i.e. every camera that is supported by the Olympus Image Share app) via WiFi to your Mac.
To use this software, your Mac has to be in the WiFi network that is hosted by your camera if you activate the WiFi option.
Currently only the import is useable, the remote-control is not completely implemented yet. There is only a proof-of-concept of the Liveview-streaming available. But you will have to tell the camera manually to activate the liveview.
