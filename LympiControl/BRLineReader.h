/**
 `BRLineReader` is a class for iOS and OS X that reads text data line by line.
 
 Data can be read from file or from a supplied `NSData` object. If reading from
 file it will be represented by a memory-mapped data object.
 
 All ASCII based text encodings and variable length encodings like UTF-8 are
 supported, but multibyte encodings like UTF-16 are not since the line delimiter
 must be represented with a single byte.
 
 For efficient memory management when dealing with large data sets it is recommended
 to put each iteration of a line reading loop in an `\@autoreleasepool` block.
